## Summary

- Non-blazar AGN PKS 0521-36 observed over 15 years by Fermi-LAT telescope.
- Lomb-Scargle and wavelet analysis reveals three Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs).
- GP modelling revealed two more QPOs.
- __First__ long-term QPO detected from a non-blazar AGN.
- Cause of QPOs remains unclear.
- Evidence for QPOs seems inconsistent.

## Data

- ROI is circular region of 10$^\circ$ radius centred at PKS 0521-36
- 15 years of observations by Fermi-LAT (August 2008 - 2023)
    - MJD 54683 -- MJD 60187 (5,504 days)
- $\gamma$-ray light curve (0.1 -- 300 GeV)
- Uniformly sampled

## Method

1. Compute Lomb-Scargle periodogram.
2. Compute Weighted wavelet Z-transform.
3. Fit Gaussian Process model with different kernels:
    - Damped Random Walk,
    - Simple Harmonic Oscillator, and
    - combinations thereof.
4. Choose best kernel combination using BIC.
4. Look for "significant" peaks in power.

- Nice application of bootstrapping to get the distribution of light curves.
- Not clear how $\beta = 0.48 \pm 0.16$ is determined

## Statistical Comments

- CARMA is a __stochastic__ process
    - CAR(1) is a special case that can be expressed as GP.
- Computationally heavy, N $\approx$ 500
    - MCMC: 32 chains with 5,000 burn-in + 10,000 steps.
- No mention of priors.
- The more data you have, the more likely you are to reach significance.
    - The difference between 3$\sigma$ vs. 5$\sigma$ might not itself be significant.

## Note on BIC

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

$$\textrm{BIC} = -2\mathcal{L} + K \log N$$

- BIC should only be used to compare between models that are subsets of eachother.
- Not surprising that BIC increases with model complexity.

## Manuscript queries {.smaller}

- QPOs don't match between LSP/WWZ and GP models
    - $T = 268, 295, 806$ days vs. $T = 283, 886$ days.
    - Used different date ranges MJD 54683 -- 60187 (15y) vs. MJD 55358 -- 59547 (11.4y) for each.
- Kelly et al. (2009) and Li & Wang (2018) are analyses of optical not $\gamma$-ray light curves.
- Where does the "quasi" come from?
    - LSP and WWZ target periodicity, not quasi-periodicity.
    - there are QP GP kernels.
- Insufficient information to reproduce, e.g., source code.
